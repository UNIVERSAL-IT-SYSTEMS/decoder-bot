What I had to do on OS X 10.9:

- Install the latest Go binary tree into /usr/local/go 
  (over from https://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/detail?name=go1.2rc3.darwin-amd64-osx10.8.tar.gz&can=2&q=)


- Portaudio:

  - checked out latest svn code:  svn co https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/portaudio/portaudio/trunk/

  - hand-edited configure.in to look for 10.8 and 10.9 SDK.

  - ./configure && make;  sudo make install

- Set $GOPATH to a new directory ~/gocode

- go get code.google.com/p/portaudio-go/portaudio
